<p><em>Extreme Sport</em> appears to be used interchageably with <em>high risk sport</em>
 in much of the research litreture. Both high risk and extreme sport are defined as any <em>sport 
 where one has to accept a possibility of severe injury or death as an inherent part of the activity</em>. In 
 the same manner classification of extreme or high risk could partly be due to peak static and dynmic components 
 achived during competion, which may result in bodily changes such as high blood pressure (eg. Squash vs. Archery)
 A further classification would consider physical risk (eg. BASE jumping vs. Darts) as a defining feature of any 
 extreme high sport</p>
